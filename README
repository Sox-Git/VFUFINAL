Hello welcome to the VFU/Psych + github!


I will list the things you can and cannot do.


##WHAT YOU CAN DO##
--------------------
1. You may use Psych + for mods under given permission from Sox
2. You may make pull requests to help the mod be optimized better
3. You may make Mobile ports, Mac, and Linux ports under given permission


##WHAT YOU CAN'T DO##
---------------------
1. Make engine "ports"
2. Make a mods folder "port" on psych. The point of this engine was to be optimized to begin with
3. Call this engine as your own. Seriously that's just stealing
4. Use the issues tab as a chat room. It was called issues for a reason
5. Ask me to add editors and all of that. This engine's purpose was to be easier for actual programmers. Not make it easy on lower knowledged ones.


##KNOWN BUGS AND SOLUTIONS##
-----------------------------
Q: Why does my game crash after beating X song?
A: This could be caused do to you not having enough RAM. I reccomend at least 4 or 8GB of RAM before playing
